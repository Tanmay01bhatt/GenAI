According to data from NASA and NOAA, 2018 marked the fourth warmest year on record, underscoring a persistent trend of increasing global temperatures. The warming trend has been particularly pronounced since 1982, with an average temperature increase of 0.11° Fahrenheit (0.06° Celsius) per decade. This rapid warming culminated in 2023, which was confirmed as the hottest year on record with a global average temperature of 14.98°C, surpassing the previous record set in 2016 by 0.17°C. April 2024 also set a new record for the hottest April, with an average surface air temperature significantly above the 1991-2020 average.\n",

            "The record-breaking years of 2018, 2023, and April 2024 highlight the alarming pace at which global temperatures are rising. The data indicates that 2023 was not just slightly warmer but exceeded past records by a significant margin. This pattern of record-breaking temperatures is a stark reminder of the ongoing impact of climate change, driven by human activities. The warming trend since 1982 is notably higher than the historical average since 1850, illustrating the acceleration in temperature increases over recent decades.\n",

            "The primary driver of these rising temperatures is the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, largely due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels. The impacts of this warming are already being felt across the globe, manifesting in more frequent and intense heat waves, rising sea levels, and extreme weather events like hurricanes, floods, and droughts. These changes are also affecting plant and animal life, as well as human health and well-being, posing significant challenges for communities worldwide.\n",
